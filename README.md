# project

The project aims to design and develop an advanced smart system for managing parking gate operations, utilizing sensing technologies and automation to enhance user experience and improve safety. The system detects the approach of vehicles near the gate using precise sensors, triggering the gate to open automatically, facilitating entry or exit without the need for human intervention.
